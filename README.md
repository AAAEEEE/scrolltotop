Scroll To Top
=============

It is a browser add-on available for Firefox, Chrome and Safari.

Scrolling on pages is really a tiring experience. Specially if the page is really big one. This plugin tries to minify this tiring experience. With this plugin it will be more fun than just scroll. It adds images at bottom-right corner of the page to give you one click scrolling to top and vice-versa with beautiful animation. You can configure the location of the icon using options page. Moreover you can stop the scrolling in-between.
