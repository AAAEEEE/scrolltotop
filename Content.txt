Scrolling on pages is really a tiring experience. Specially if the page is really big one. This plugin tries to minify this tiring experience. With this plugin it will be more fun than just scroll. It adds an image at bottom-right corner of the page to give you one click scrolling to top and vice-versa with beautiful animation. There are lot other features and lots of customization.
